            To everyone who has played and enjoyed KanyeGuess,<br><br>
            This project started as a way to celebrate Kanye West’s music—his creativity, his influence, and the impact his songs have had on so many of us.<br>
            I spent the past year building this site out of admiration for his work, believing that his music could exist separately from his controversies.<br>
            But some lines just shouldn’t be crossed.<br><br>
        
            Over the past few days, Ye has gone beyond being provocative—he has fully embraced racism, antisemitism, and overall hatred.<br>
            If you’ve seen his <a href="./YeRant.pdf">february 7th X/Twitter rant</a>, you know exactly what I mean.<br><br>
            
            What once felt like artistic rebellion has turned into something much darker.<br>
            When someone openly praises Hitler and calls themselves a Nazi, this isn’t just “controversy” or “free speech” anymore. It’s something far more serious.<br><br>
        
            Because of this, I can no longer, in good conscience, keep running a website dedicated to Kanye West.<br>
            No amount of musical talent can outweigh the damage he is doing.<br><br>
        
            I know many of you who love Ye’s music might be disappointed.<br>
            I get it. I’ve spent years admiring his work, defending his vision, and hoping he would find his way back.<br>
            But at some point, you have to face the truth.<br><br>
        
            Thank you to everyone who played, enjoyed, and supported this project. It truly means a lot.<br>
            If Kanye ever takes real responsibility for his words and actions, I’ll be the first to hope for his redemption. Until then… well, you read the title.
